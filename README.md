Domain Language Redirect
========================

Domain Language Redirect; takes care of domain based language redirects in Symphony.

Requires FL-Language to be installed; checks the languages available & gives a list in preferences where you insert a domain for each language.

Includes a datasource with the list of domains and the related languages.

In the near future will include htaccess redirects or similar behaviour.
